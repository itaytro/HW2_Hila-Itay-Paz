# Responsive CSS Project – Web Programming Exercise 2
This repository contains the complete solution for Homework Assignment 2 in the Web Programming course, which required creating a single responsive HTML page using four different styling variations.

## Project Goal
The primary objective was to create a responsive layout where the content boxes are displayed side-by-side for screen widths greater than 750 pixels, and stacked vertically (one below the other) for widths of 750 pixels and below. This responsiveness must be implemented using Media Queries , strictly using Plain CSS (without Bootstrap or Flexbox) for the manual version.

## Project Structure
The project includes four HTML files that implement the same layout, each using a different styling method:
1. manual.html - CSS Plain
2. plain.html - CSS Plain (No Flexbox/Bootstrap), Hila (Generated by Copilot)
3. flex.html - Flexbox, Itay (Generated by Copilot)
4. bootstrap.html - Bootstrap, Paz (Generated by Copilot)

## GitHub Pages Website

## How to Use and Test:
1. Entry Point: Open the index.html file (or navigate to the GitHub Pages link above).
2. Navigation: The index page contains 4 links leading to the four different versions of the responsive layout.
3. Responsiveness Check: Test the pages on both desktop and mobile devices (or by resizing the browser window on desktop) to ensure the breakpoint at 750 pixels works correctly.
4. Comparison: Compare the manual CSS solution (Part A) with the solutions generated by Copilot (Part B) to understand the differences in implementation.

## Requirements Covered
* Responsive layout implementation.
* Use of media queries for the breakpoint at 750 pixels.
* Four alternative implementations (Manual Plain CSS, Copilot Plain CSS, Copilot Flexbox, Copilot Bootstrap).
* Public GitHub repository.
* GitHub Pages deployment.
* index.html with 4 required links.
* README file with the site link.
* Mobile and desktop compatibility ensured.

### Notes
The solutions in Part B were created with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, and while they aim for a "near-perfect solution", differences from the manual version may exist.
These differences are discussed in each student's video submission.
